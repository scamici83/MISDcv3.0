MISDc v3.0 is a semidistributed conceptual hydrological model for estimating the main fluxes (evapotranspiration, runoff)
and storages (soil water content and snow water equivalent) of an anthropised basin where water is used for irrigation and 
for civil and industrial water uses.  
The MISDc v3.0 model code is distributed through M language files. It is worth to specify that the model could be run with 
different interpreters of M language, like the GNU Octave (freely downloadable here https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/download). 
To run the code with GNU Octave it is needed to load the packages "statistics" and "optim". The MISDc v3.0 model can be freely 
applied and used. The authors are highly interested to collaborate for the understanding of the model functioning and to improve 
its performance and applicability.
